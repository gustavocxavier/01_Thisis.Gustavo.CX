It can help you to build your online professional profile, enhance your communication skills, stay atop the latest and greatest trends and tools, connect with other data scientists, and even solicit feedback from those in the community.\n\nBut arguably one of the most valuable reasons to blog is to get a whole lot better at doing whatever it is you want to write about. You've probably heard some version of the saying, *\"The best way to learn something is to teach it to others\"* -- not only do I find this to be true of myself, but there's also science[^1] to back this up!\n\n[^1]: This is sometimes referred to as the Protégé Effect or the Feynman Learning Technique. You can learn a bit more from [@Nestojko2014protege] and [@Ambio2020Feynman]\n\nStill, getting started can be a bit intimidating (I'm only doing this for the first time now myself). It an attempt to make it a little less so for the next blogger-to-be, I have tried to gather some ideas, instructions, and inspiration to get things going. If nothing else, I think heeding the advice of this tweet[^2] is a pretty good place to start:\n\n[^2]: I might also add that having to look up something 3x *for yourself* might be a good reason to blog about it.
