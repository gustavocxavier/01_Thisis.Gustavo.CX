At the end, the group gained confidence to employ their own strategies and further enhance the models, resulting in improved performance in the competition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe solution involved three steps:\nCareful exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain a deep understanding of the data;\nTraining a set of models by running a notebook in the background utilizing Kaggle’s GPU, and;\nImplementing a stacked models approach to combine the best-performing models.\nCheck out a Kaggle notebook example"

Then, analyze investment plans in a firm-level is not an easy task, due to the plans are not observable. So in this project I proposed to measure the firm Expected Investment Growth (EIG) based on a combination of machine learning tools and text regression. Check out the github repository"
