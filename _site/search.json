Then, analyze investment plans in a firm-level is not an easy task, due to the plans are not observable. So in this project I proposed to measure the firm Expected Investment Growth (EIG) based on a combination of machine learning tools and text regression. Check out the github repository"

It can help you to build your online professional profile, enhance your communication skills, stay atop the latest and greatest trends and tools, connect with other data scientists, and even solicit feedback from those in the community.\nBut arguably one of the most valuable reasons to blog is to get a whole lot better at doing whatever it is you want to write about. You’ve probably heard some version of the saying, “The best way to learn something is to teach it to others” – not only do I find this to be true of myself, but there’s also science1 to back this up!\nStill, getting started can be a bit intimidating (I’m only doing this for the first time now myself). It an attempt to make it a little less so for the next blogger-to-be, I have tried to gather some ideas, instructions, and inspiration to get things going. If nothing else, I think heeding the advice of this tweet2 is a pretty good place to start:\n\n\nWhen you’ve written the same code 3 times, write a functionWhen you’ve given the same in-person advice 3 times, write a blog post\n\n— David Robinson (@drob) November 9, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nThis is sometimes referred to as the Protégé Effect or the Feynman Learning Technique. You can learn a bit more from [@Nestojko2014protege] and [@Ambio2020Feynman]↩︎\nI might also add that having to look up something 3x for yourself might be a good reason to blog about it. Read David Robinson’s full post about starting a data science blog here.↩︎"

    "text": "Data science distinguishes itself from data analysis because it tells you what to do and what the result will be. Where data analysis gives you information about the current situation, data analytics makes predictions and tells you what the result would be by taking a certain action. In other words: data sciency focuses on the past and current situation, data analytics focuses on the future.\n\nGOAL\nHow can we make a recommendation system? How can we categorize our customers and take actions separately for each group? How can we identify objects based on specific characteristics? All these kind of questions can be answered by using data analytics techniques.\n\n\nRESULT\nBy using statistics, programming and machine learning techniques, I can find patterns hidden in the data. With this information I can make an algorithm, probability estimation or statistical model which you can use to make the right decisions.\n\n\nPROJECT DURATION\nProject duration varies between 3 weeks – 2 months. The project starts by getting an understanding of the situation and gathering the right data. After collecting the right data, I start analyzing the data and share the results. Finally, I will make the algorithm or model which you can implement in your business.\n\n\nCASE\n\nWHICH CUSTOMERS ARE LIKELY TO CHURN?\nThe ability to predict when a customer is at a high risk of churning is valuable for every business with returning customers. Churn is defined as the number of customers cancelling within a time period divided by the number of active customers at the start of that period. In order to apply a modeling technique to predict churn, we need to understand the customer behavior and characteristics which signal the risk of customers churn.\nIn this example, I will look into an electricity company. An electricity company is a good example because customers 'return' every month.\n\n\nWHAT CHARACTERISTICS ARE SPECIFIC TO CHURNED CUSTOMERS?\nFirst step of the churn analysis is to select the characteristics of customers which could predict churn. Characteristics can be categorized, for example:\nCustomer characteristics\n\nAge of a person\nNumber of people in household\n\nBehavioral characteristics\n\nAverage amount of electricity spend per month\nTime since sign up\n\nUsually, you have as many characteristics as possible (for example 50) of which you can select the ones with highest prediction power.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWHAT IS THE CUSTOMER LIFETIME VALUE FOR EACH CUSTOMER?\nAnother calculation which supports the churn prediction is to calculate the customer lifetime value (CLV or LTV). The CLV is a prediction of the total value generated by a customer in the past and in the future.\n\n\n\nData analytics case - CLV and lifetime\n\n\n \n\n\nHOW CAN WE PREDICT IF A CUSTOMER IS LIKELY TO CHURN?\nA statistical model calculates the churn probability for each customer. This model uses selected characteristics, the CLV and expected lifetime. Each element is weighted such that the accuracy of churning is maximized. After developing the model, the model is applied to all customers such that we obtain the likelihood of churning for each customer. Ranking the results gives you the top X customers who are about to churn.\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to know more about data analytics? Please get in touch with me here.\nThe case below is an example how to predict churn for recurring customers within an electricity company."
