    "text": "Data science distinguishes itself from data analysis because it tells you what to do and what the result will be. Where data analysis gives you information about the current situation, data analytics makes predictions and tells you what the result would be by taking a certain action. In other words: data sciency focuses on the past and current situation, data analytics focuses on the future.\nThe case below is an example how to predict churn for recurring customers within an electricity company.\n:::: columns\n::: {.column width=“10%”}\n::: {.column width=“20%”}\nPROJECT DURATION\nProject duration varies between 3 weeks – 2 months. The project starts by getting an understanding of the situation and gathering the right data. After collecting the right data, I start analyzing the data and share the results. Finally, I will make the algorithm or model which you can implement in your business."

    "text": "CASE – WHICH CUSTOMERS ARE LIKELY TO CHURN?\nThe ability to predict when a customer is at a high risk of churning is valuable for every business with returning customers. Churn is defined as the number of customers cancelling within a time period divided by the number of active customers at the start of that period. In order to apply a modeling technique to predict churn, we need to understand the customer behavior and characteristics which signal the risk of customers churn.\nIn this example, I will look into an electricity company. An electricity company is a good example because customers ‘return’ every month."
