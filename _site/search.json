Each page shows the most important trends and figures.\n\nGOAL\nThe purpose of a dashboard is to view the most important KPI's and results at a glance. Dashboards are an interactive way to see how the company or project perform.\n\n\nRESULT\nBy using dashboards, you will discover the right insights in an easy way. You can apply filters yourself and consult different graphs. By immediately having the right information available, correct decisions can be made.\n\n\nPROJECT DURATION\nOn average, the development of a dashboard takes 2 weeks – 2 months. The development consists of two phases:\n\nselection of KPI's and design of the dashboard\ncollecting data and dashboard development\n\n\nWant to know more about dashboards?

Churn is defined as the number of customers cancelling within a time period divided by the number of active customers at the start of that period. In order to apply a modeling technique to predict churn, we need to understand the customer behavior and characteristics which signal the risk of customers churn.\nIn this example, I will look into an electricity company. An electricity company is a good example because customers 'return' every month.\n\n\nWHAT CHARACTERISTICS ARE SPECIFIC TO CHURNED CUSTOMERS?\nFirst step of the churn analysis is to select the characteristics of customers which could predict churn. Characteristics can be categorized, for example:\nCustomer characteristics\n\nAge of a person\nNumber of people in household\n\nBehavioral characteristics\n\nAverage amount of electricity spend per month\nTime since sign up\n\nUsually, you have as many characteristics as possible (for example 50) of which you can select the ones with highest prediction power.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWHAT IS THE CUSTOMER LIFETIME VALUE FOR EACH CUSTOMER?\nAnother calculation which supports the churn prediction is to calculate the customer lifetime value (CLV or LTV). The CLV is a prediction of the total value generated by a customer in the past and in the future.\n\n\n\nData analytics case - CLV and lifetime\n\n\n \n\n\nHOW CAN WE PREDICT IF A CUSTOMER IS LIKELY TO CHURN?\nA statistical model calculates the churn probability for each customer. This model uses selected characteristics, the CLV and expected lifetime. Each element is weighted such that the accuracy of churning is maximized. After developing the model, the model is applied to all customers such that we obtain the likelihood of churning for each customer. Ranking the results gives you the top X customers who are about to churn.\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to know more about data analytics? Please get in touch with me here.\nThe case below is an example how to predict churn for recurring customers within an electricity company."
