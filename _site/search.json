    "text": "Data science distinguishes itself from data analysis because it tells you what to do and what the result will be. Where data analysis gives you information about the current situation, data analytics makes predictions and tells you what the result would be by taking a certain action. In other words: data sciency focuses on the past and current situation, data analytics focuses on the future.\n\nGOAL\nHow can we make a recommendation system? How can we categorize our customers and take actions separately for each group? How can we identify objects based on specific characteristics? All these kind of questions can be answered by using data analytics techniques.\n\n\nRESULT\nBy using statistics, programming and machine learning techniques, I can find patterns hidden in the data. With this information I can make an algorithm, probability estimation or statistical model which you can use to make the right decisions.\n\n\nPROJECT DURATION\nProject duration varies between 3 weeks – 2 months. The project starts by getting an understanding of the situation and gathering the right data. After collecting the right data, I start analyzing the data and share the results. Finally, I will make the algorithm or model which you can implement in your business.\n\n\nCASE\n\nWHICH CUSTOMERS ARE LIKELY TO CHURN?\nThe ability to predict when a customer is at a high risk of churning is valuable for every business with returning customers. Churn is defined as the number of customers cancelling within a time period divided by the number of active customers at the start of that period. In order to apply a modeling technique to predict churn, we need to understand the customer behavior and characteristics which signal the risk of customers churn.\nIn this example, I will look into an electricity company. An electricity company is a good example because customers 'return' every month.\n\n\nWHAT CHARACTERISTICS ARE SPECIFIC TO CHURNED CUSTOMERS?\nFirst step of the churn analysis is to select the characteristics of customers which could predict churn. Characteristics can be categorized, for example:\nCustomer characteristics\n\nAge of a person\nNumber of people in household\n\nBehavioral characteristics\n\nAverage amount of electricity spend per month\nTime since sign up\n\nUsually, you have as many characteristics as possible (for example 50) of which you can select the ones with highest prediction power.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWHAT IS THE CUSTOMER LIFETIME VALUE FOR EACH CUSTOMER?\nAnother calculation which supports the churn prediction is to calculate the customer lifetime value (CLV or LTV). The CLV is a prediction of the total value generated by a customer in the past and in the future.\n\n\n\nData analytics case - CLV and lifetime\n\n\n \n\n\nHOW CAN WE PREDICT IF A CUSTOMER IS LIKELY TO CHURN?\nA statistical model calculates the churn probability for each customer. This model uses selected characteristics, the CLV and expected lifetime. Each element is weighted such that the accuracy of churning is maximized. After developing the model, the model is applied to all customers such that we obtain the likelihood of churning for each customer. Ranking the results gives you the top X customers who are about to churn.\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to know more about data analytics? Please get in touch with me here.\nThe case below is an example how to predict churn for recurring customers within an electricity company."

At the end, the group gained confidence to employ their own strategies and further enhance the models, resulting in improved performance in the competition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe solution involved three steps:\nCareful exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain a deep understanding of the data;\nTraining a set of models by running a notebook in the background utilizing Kaggle’s GPU, and;\nImplementing a stacked models approach to combine the best-performing models.\nCheck out a Kaggle notebook example"

    "text": "Big Research Project\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA long research project to develop a reliable measure measure of firm-level investment plans based on text data from MD&A (Management Discussion and Analysis) disclosure in 10-K filings, which I do by using a combination of the forecast procedure of Han et al. (2020) with the idea of time varying dictionary developed by Lima, Godeiro and Mohsin (2020).\nThis novel measure is relevant because despite the literature provide support to the importance of investment plans in both aggregate-level and firm-level (LI; WANG; YU, 2020; HOU et al., 2020), this last one receives less attention since it is empirically challenging to measure firm-level investment plans (LIN; LIN, 2018). Then, analyze investment plans in a firm-level is not an easy task, due to the plans are not observable. So in this project I proposed to measure the firm Expected Investment Growth (EIG) based on a combination of machine learning tools and text regression. Check out the github repository"
