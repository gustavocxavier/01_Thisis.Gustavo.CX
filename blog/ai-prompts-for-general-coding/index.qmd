## Code debugging workflows

### Debugging Python code

``` prompt-block
I want you to be a Python programmer, here is a piece of Python code containing 
[problem] --- \[insert code snippet] --- I am getting the following error 
[insert error]. What is the reason for the bug?
```

### Debugging R code

``` prompt-block
I want you to be an R programmer, here is a piece of R code containing
[problem] --- [insert code snippet] --- I am getting the following error 
[insert error]. What is the reason for the bug?
```

### Debugging SQL code

``` prompt-block
I want you to be a SQL programmer, here is a piece of SQL code
containing [problem] --- [insert code snippet] --- I am getting the
following error [insert error]. What is the reason for the bug?
```

## Code explanation workflows

### Python code explanation

``` prompt-block
I want you to act as a code explainer in Python. I don't understand
this function. Can you please explain what it does, and provide an
example? [Insert function]
```

### R code explanation

``` prompt-block
I want you to act as a code explainer in R. I don't understand this
function. Can you please explain what it does, and provide an example?
[Insert function]
```

### SQL code explanation

``` prompt-block
I want you to act as a code explainer in SQL. I don't understand this
snippet. Can you please explain what it does, and provide an example?

[Insert SQL query]
```

## Code optimization workflows

### Python code optimization

``` prompt-block
I want you to act as a code optimizer in Python.

[Describe problem with current code, if possible].

Can you make the code [more Pythonic/more efficient/run faster/
cleaner/more readable]? 

[Insert Code]
```

### R code optimization

``` prompt-block
I want you to act as a code optimizer in R. [Describe problem with
current code, if possible]. Can you make the code 
[cleaner/more efficient/run faster/more readable]? [Insert Code]
```

### SQL code optimization

``` prompt-block
I want you to act as a query optimizer in SQL. [Describe problem with
current code, if possible]. Can you suggest ways to make the query
[run faster/more readable/simpler]? [Insert Code]
```

## Code simplification workflows

### Python code simplification

``` prompt-block
I want you to act as a programmer in Python. Please simplify this code
while ensuring that it is [efficient/easy to read/Pythonic]? [Insert
Code]
```

### R code simplification

``` prompt-block

I want you to act as a programmer in R. Please simplify this code
while ensuring that it is [efficient/easy to read]? [Insert Code]
```

### SQL code simplification

``` prompt-block

I want you to act as a SQL programmer. I am running [PostgreSQL
14/MySQL 8/SQLite 3.4/other versions.]. Can you please simplify this
query [while ensuring that it is efficient/easy to read/insert any
additional requirements]?
```

## Code translation workflows

### From R to Python code translation

``` prompt-block

I want you to act as a programmer in R.  Please translate this code
to Python. [Insert code]
```

### From Python to R code translation

``` prompt-block

I want you to act as a programmer in Python. Please translate this
code to R. [Insert code]
```

## Code quality and testing workflows

### Compare function speeds in python

``` prompt-block

I want you to act as a Python programmer.  Can you write code that
compares the speed of two functions [functionname] and [functionname]?

[Insert functions]
```

### Write unit tests in R

``` prompt-block

I want you to act as a R Programmer. Can you please write unit tests
for the function [functionname]? [Insert requirements for unit tests,
if any] [Insert code]
```

### Write unit tests in Python

``` prompt-block
I want you to act as a Python Programmer. Can you please write unit
tests for the function [functionname]? [Insert requirements for unit
tests, if any] [Insert code]
```
