## R data visualization workflows

### Creating plots in ggplot2

``` prompt-block

I want you to act as a data scientist coding in R. Given a dataframe
[dataframe name] containing the columns [column names] Use ggplot2
to plot a [chart type and requirement].
```

### Gridplot visualizations in ggplot2

``` prompt-block

I want you to act as a data scientist coding in R. Given a dataframe
[dataframe name] containing the columns [column names]. Use ggplot2
to plot a pair plot that shows the relationship of one variable
against another.
```

### Annotating and formatting plots

``` prompt-block

I want you to act as a data scientist coding in R. Given a dataframe
[dataframe name] containing the columns [column names], use ggplot2 
to plot a [chart type] the relationship between [variables]. 
[Insert annotation and formatting requirements]
```

### Changing plot themes in ggplot2

``` prompt-block

I want you to act as a data scientist coding in R. Given a dataframe
[dataframe name] containing the columns [column names], use ggplot2
to to plot a [chart type] the relationship between [variables].
Change the color theme to match that of [theme]
```

## Python data visualization workflows

### Creating plots with matplotlib

``` prompt-block

I want you to act as a data scientist coding in Python.  Given a
dataframe [dataframe name] containing the columns [column names]
Use matplotlib  to plot a [chart type and requirement].
```
