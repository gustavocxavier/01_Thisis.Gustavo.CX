## Python time series analysis workflows

### Changing time horizons using pandas

``` prompt-block

I want you to act as a data scientist coding in Python. Given a
time series data in a Pandas dataframe [dataframe name] with
timestamp Index in [original frequency] frequency with one column
[column name], convert the timestamp frequency to [desired frequency].
```

### Build test series model

``` prompt-block

I want you to act as a data scientist coding in Python. Given a time
series data in a dataframe [dataframe name] with timestamp Index in
[original frequency] frequency with one column [column name],  build a
forecasting model, assuming data is stationary.
```

### Perform stationarity test

``` prompt-block

I want you to act as a data scientist coding in Python. Given a time
series data in a dataframe [dataframe name] with timestamp Index in
[original frequency] frequency with one column [column name], perform
a Dicky Fuller test.
```

## R time series analysis workflows

### Changing time horizons 

``` prompt-block

I want you to act as a data scientist coding in R. Given a time series
data in a dataframe [dataframe name] with timestamp Index in [original
frequency] frequency with one column [column name], convert the
timestamp frequency to [desired frequency].
```
