## General machine learning workflow

### Feature engineering ideation

``` prompt-block

I want you to act as a data scientist. Given a dataset of [dataset
name] that contains the [columns], you are to predict [predicted
variable]. Suggest data that will be helpful for this problem and
perform feature engineering for this problem.
```

## Python machine learning workflow

### Model training workflow

``` prompt-block

I want you to act as a data scientist programming in Python. Given a
dataset of [dataframe name] that contains the [column name], write
code to predict [output variable].
```

### Hyperparameter tuning workflow

``` prompt-block

I want you to act as a data scientist programming in Python. Given a
[type of model] model, write code to tune the hyperparameter.
```

### Model explainability workflow

``` prompt-block

I want you to act as a data scientist programming in Python. Given a
[type of model] that predicts the [predictor variable], write code that 
explains an output using Shap values.
```

## R machine learning workflow

### Model training workflow

``` prompt-block

I want you to act as a data scientist programming in R. Given a
dataframe of [dataframe name] that contains [column names], 
write code to predict [output].
```

### Hyperparameter tuning workflow

``` prompt-block

I want you to act as a data scientist programming in R. Given 
a [type of model] model, write code to tune the hyperparameter.
```

### Model explainability workflow

``` prompt-block

I want you to act as a data scientist programming in R. Given a
[type of model] that predicts the [predictor variable], write code that explains
an output using Shap values.
