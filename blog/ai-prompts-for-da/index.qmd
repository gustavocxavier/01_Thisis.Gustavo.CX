## SQL data analysis workflows

### Data generation & creating tables

``` prompt-block

I want you to act as a data generator. Can you write SQL queries in
[database version] that create a table [table name] with the columns
[column name]. Include relevant constraints and index.
```

### Common table expressions

``` prompt-block

I want you to act as a SQL code programmer. I am running [database
version]. Can you rewrite this query using CTE? [Insert query]
```

### Write SQL queries from natural language

#### Example: Data aggregation in SQL

``` prompt-block

I want you to act as a data scientist. [Insert description of tables].
Can you [count/sum/take average] of [value] which are [insert filters]
```

#### Example: 7 day running average in SQL

``` prompt-block

I want you to act as a data scientist.  I am running [PostgreSQL
14/MySQL 8/SQLite 3.4/other versions.]. I have the tables [table_name]
which are [table description]. The sales table consists of the columns
[column names]. Can you please write a query that finds the 7-day
running average of [quantity]?
```

#### Example: Window functions in SQL

``` prompt-block

I want you to act as a data scientist.  I am running [PostgreSQL
14/MySQL 8/SQLite 3.4/other versions.]. I have the tables 
[table_name] which are [table description]. The sales table consists
of the columns [column names]. Can you please write a query that
finds [required window function]?
```

#### Example: Window functions in SQL

``` prompt-block

I want you to act as a data scientist.  I am running [PostgreSQL
14/MySQL 8/SQLite 3.4/other versions.]. I have the tables 
[table_name] which are [table description]. The sales table consists
of the columns [column names]. Can you please write a query that
finds [required window function]?
```

## Python data analysis workflows

### Data generation workflow

#### Example: Generate Markdown

``` prompt-block

I want you to act as a data generator in Python. Can you generate a
Markdown file that contains [data requirement]. Save the file to
[filename]
```

#### Example: Generate CSV

``` prompt-block

I want you to act as a data generator in Python. Can you generate a
CSV file that contains [data requirement]. Save the file to
[filename]
```

#### Example: Generate JSON

``` prompt-block

I want you to act as a data generator in Python. Can you generate a
JSON file that contains [data requirement]. Save the file to
[filename]
```

### Data cleaning workflow

``` prompt-block

I want you to act as a data scientist programming in Python Pandas.
Given a CSV file that contains data of [dataframe name]  with the
columns [colum names]  for [dataset context], write code to clean
the data? [Insert requirements for data]
```

### Data analysis workflow in pandas

#### Example: Data Aggregation

``` prompt-block

I want you to act as a data scientist programming in Python Pandas.
Given a table [table name] that consists of the columns [column
names]  can you please write a query that finds [requirement]?
```

#### Example: Data Merging

``` prompt-block

I want you to act as a data scientist programming in Python Pandas.
Given a table [table 1 name]  that consists of the columns [column
names]  and another table [table 2 name]  with the columns [column
names], please merge the two tables. [Insert additional requirement,
if any]
```

#### Example: Data Reshaping

``` prompt-block

I want you to act as a data scientist programming in Python Pandas.
Given a table [table name] that consists of the columns [column
names]  can you aggregate the [value]  by [column] and convert it
from long to wide format?
```

#### Example: Generate Markdown

``` prompt-block

I want you to act as a data generator in R. Can you generate a
Markdown file that contains [data requirement]. Save the file to
[filename]
```

## R data analysis workflows

### Data generation workflow 

#### Example: Generate Markdown

``` prompt-block

I want you to act as a data generator in R. Can you generate a
Markdown file that contains [data requirement]. Save the file to
[filename]
```

#### Example: Generate CSV

``` prompt-block

I want you to act as a data generator in R. Can you generate a CSV
file that contains [data requirement]. Save the file to [filename]
```

#### Example: Generate JSON

``` prompt-block

I want you to act as a data generator in R. Can you generate a JSON
file that contains [data requirement]. Save the file to [filename]
```

### Data cleaning workflow

``` prompt-block

I want you to act as a data scientist programming in R tidyr. You are
given the [dataframe name] dataframe containing the columns [column
name]. [Insert requirement]
```

### Data analysis workflow in tidyr

#### Data Aggregation

``` prompt-block

I want you to act as a data scientist programming in R tidyr. You 
are given the [dataframe name] dataframe containing the columns
[column name]. [Insert requirement]
```

#### Data Merging

``` prompt-block

I want you to act as a data scientist programming in R tidyr. You are
given the [dataframe 1 name] dataframe containing the columns
[column name]. You also have a [dataframe 2 name] dataframe
containing the columns [column name]. Find the [required output] 
```

#### Example: Data Reshaping (Long to Wide)

``` prompt-block

I want you to act as a data scientist programming in R tidyr.
You are given the [dataframe name] dataframe containing the 
columns [column name].  Please convert the data to wide format.
```

#### Example: Data Reshaping (Wide to Long)

``` prompt-block

I want you to act as a data scientist programming in R tidyr.
You are given the [dataframe name] dataframe containing the 
columns [column name].  Please convert the data to long format.
```
